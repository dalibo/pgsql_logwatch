Logwatch configuration files and script for PostgreSQL

Configuration and script for PostgreSQL is missing in the default Logwatch
distribution; here are the files:

    logfiles_postgresql.conf
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/conf/logfiles/postgresql.conf
		and adapt the path to the PostgreSQL logfile.
		
		$> 

    services_postgresql.conf
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/conf/services/postgresql.conf

    scripts_postgresql
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/postgresql
		and make it executable.

Prerequisite: if you are using stderr as PostgreSQL log_destination, you must at
least set log_line_prefix = '%t ' in the postgresql.conf file.

You can test the logwatch output by using the following command:

	/usr/sbin/logwatch --detail Med --service postgresql --range Today

pgsql_logwatch is (C) 2011 by Dalibo - http://www.dalibo.com/ written by
Gilles Darold. The code was heavily based on the mysql script by Jeremias Reith
