Logwatch configuration files and script for PostgreSQL

Configuration and script for PostgreSQL is missing in the default Logwatch
distribution; here are the files:

    logfiles_postgresql.conf
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/conf/logfiles/postgresql.conf
		and adapt the path to the PostgreSQL logfile.

    services_postgresql.conf
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/conf/services/postgresql.conf

    scripts_postgresql
		place this file as /etc/logwatch/scripts/services/postgresql
		and make it executable.

You can test the logwatch output by using the following command:

	/usr/sbin/logwatch --detail Med --service postgresql --range Today
